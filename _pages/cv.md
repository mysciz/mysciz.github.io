### Amphibious UAV based on multimodal control
* Worked on xi’an jiaotong university
* Provincial Innovation Training Program
* Brief introduction: In order to adapt to complex environments and fulfill diverse survey tasks, we plan to design a
multimodal survey UAV. It combines the ability of ground movement and air flight. The land system adopts STM32 and
PID algorithm to realize the functions of rapid movement and cross-country obstacle avoidance. The flight system, on
the other hand, combines flight control and on-board computer to support autonomous flight and survey identification.
We also explore the application of ROS in this project to realize integrated control. At the same time, we continue to
improve the visual survey capability of the UAV with the computer vision technology of the original "Convolutional
Neural Network-based Detection and Bomb-Dropping Integrated Multi-Rotor UAV" national-level Daichuang project.

Hello!

My name is Zhenliang Zhou, a sophomore from Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology(with honor). Based on my first year in the Mechanical Engineering program and my experience in robotics competitions, I was introduced to computer vision and robotics. Much to my surprise, I managed to become a member of the Computer Experimentation Program and embarked on a path that I thought was right for me.

I want to do work that only I can do, at the intersection of computer vision and robotics, and I want to prove that I'm suited for that path!

At present, I am eagerly looking for a research assistant position in the field of robotics. If you are interested, you can contact me through my email at sciz.mail@stu.xjtu.edu.cn.

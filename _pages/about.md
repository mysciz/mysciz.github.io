Hello!

My name is Zhenliang Zhou, a soon-to-be sophomore from Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology(with honor). In the freshman major change exam, I successfully transferred from intelligent manufacturing to computer science. I have a keen interest in participating in the design, construction, and development of intelligent robots. Currently, I am a member of the ROBOCON Robotics Club at Xi'an Jiaotong University which dedicates to participating in [ABU ROBOCON Robotics Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon), where I am responsible for mechanical design. In addition, I am actively learning about control, vision, and other knowledge required for conducting robotics research.

At present, I am eagerly looking for a research assistant position in the field of robotics. If you are interested, you can contact me through my email at sciz.mail@stu.xjtu.edu.cn.

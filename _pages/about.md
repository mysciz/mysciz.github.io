  HELLO！My name is Zhenliang Zhou, a freshman from Xi’an Jiaotong University, majoring in Intelligent Manufacturing Engineering.I have always been passionate about building my own robot from the ground up, but in the long term, I aim to push the frontiers of robotics and bring about a revolution in the field! To achieve this, I aspire to make a significant contribution to the advancement of robot vision and control.Now I am a member of Xi'an Jiaotong University ROBOCON Robot Club which dedicates to participating in [ABU ROBOCON Robotics Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon). By interacting and cooperating with each other on the robot club,I have gained a more in-depth understanding of the implementation of robotics technology.To acquire the necessary skills and knowledge for my inaugural scientific research endeavor in robotics, I am currently engaged in deep learning studies. Concurrently, I aspire to secure a research assistantship in the realm of robotics during my sophomore year, marking the commencement of my research journey.

  HELLO！My name is Zhenliang Zhou, a freshman from Xi’an Jiaotong University, majoring in Intelligent Manufacturing Engineering.I'm always looking forward to building my own robot from scratch, but in the long run, I want to push the boundaries of robotics and revolutionize it!To do it,I aspire to make a small contribution to robot vision and control.Now I am a member of Xi'an Jiaotong University ROBOCON Robot Club which dedicates to participating in ABU ROBOCON Robotics Competition (ROBOCON is an international university robotics competition that promotes engineering creativity and teamwork through annual challenges). By interacting and cooperating with each other on the robot club,I have gained a more in-depth understanding of the implementation of robotics technology.To acquire the necessary skills and knowledge for my inaugural scientific research endeavor in robotics, I am currently engaged in deep learning studies. Concurrently, I aspire to secure a research assistantship in the realm of robotics during my sophomore year, marking the commencement of my research journey.
